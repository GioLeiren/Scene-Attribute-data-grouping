# Scene Attribute data grouping
In this project, you will work with data that has the same source as Project 2: the Scene Attribute Dataset. The objective is to use the data from this set to group samples according to the similarity of image characteristics (based on the objects present in them).
The idea is to implement a K-Medoids grouping method and the algorithm to be used is called PAM (from "Partitioning Around Medoids" or partitioning around prototypes), invented by Kaufman and Rousseeuw in 1987.
